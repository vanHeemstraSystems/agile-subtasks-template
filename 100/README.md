# Design Detailed Solution Architecture

> This breakdown provides a detailed view of each task involved in implementing Threagile, along with story point estimates for agile planning.

1. **Set Up Artifactory**  
   - **Description**: Configure JFrog Artifactory to manage Docker images, ensuring it can pull from Docker Hub. Set permissions and access controls for the team.
   - **Estimated Story Points**: 3

2. **Whitelisting Proxy Connection**  
   - **Description**: Request that the companyâ€™s proxy whitelist the Threagile Docker Image URL for uninterrupted access. Follow up with IT for confirmation.
   - **Estimated Story Points**: 2

3. **Download Threagile Docker Image**  
   - **Description**: Use the company proxy to pull the Threagile Docker image from Docker Hub to Artifactory. Verify the image integrity and version.
   - **Estimated Story Points**: 3

4. **Configure Docker Environment**  
   - **Description**: Set up a Docker environment on local or server infrastructure. Ensure Docker is properly installed and configured to work with Artifactory.
   - **Estimated Story Points**: 5

5. **Create Docker Compose File** (if applicable)  
   - **Description**: Develop a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the Threagile service and any necessary dependencies (e.g., databases, web servers).
   - **Estimated Story Points**: 3

6. **Environment Configuration**  
   - **Description**: Configure environment variables for Threagile, including database connections, API keys, and other required settings.
   - **Estimated Story Points**: 2

7. **Deployment**  
   - **Description**: Deploy the Threagile Docker container using the downloaded image from Artifactory. Ensure the container starts correctly and is accessible.
   - **Estimated Story Points**: 5

8. **Integration with Bitbucket**  
   - **Description**: Set up Threagile to connect with the Atlassian Bitbucket repository for scanning. Configure webhooks or polling mechanisms for automatic vulnerability scanning.
   - **Estimated Story Points**: 4

9. **Run Initial Scan**  
   - **Description**: Execute an initial vulnerability scan of the code repository to validate the setup. Review the results and ensure the reporting functionality works as expected.
   - **Estimated Story Points**: 3

10. **Implement Notification System**  
    - **Description**: Configure notifications for vulnerability alerts through email or Bitbucket integrations.
    - **Estimated Story Points**: 3

11. **Documentation and Training**  
    - **Description**: Document the setup process and usage instructions. Conduct training sessions to familiarize engineers with Threagile and its features.
    - **Estimated Story Points**: 5

12. **Establish Feedback Mechanism**  
    - **Description**: Create a process for collecting feedback from users regarding the tool's functionality and any issues encountered.
    - **Estimated Story Points**: 2

13. **Monitor and Maintain**  
    - **Description**: Set up monitoring for the Threagile service to ensure uptime and performance. Plan for regular updates and maintenance of the Docker image and configurations.
    - **Estimated Story Points**: 4
